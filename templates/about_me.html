                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I'm Vannsh Jagtiani, a student of 11-S at The Shri Ram School, Moulsari. I am a curious and passionate
                        learner with a love for problem-solving and an innate desire to make a difference in the world. As someone
                        with strong academic capabilities and a knack for public speaking, I’ve participated and won awards in several
                        Model United Nations (MUNs) and debate competitions. However, my true passion lies in bridging communication
                        gaps for individuals who face challenges in expressing themselves, especially those who are neurodivergent or
                        struggle with speech and hearing disabilities.
                        Previously, I created Awaaz Mitr, an app that helps neurodivergent students learn Hindi, inspired by the
                        struggles I witnessed in those around me. Now, I am working on my latest innovation: a website powered by a
                        Language Learning Model (LLM) to aid public speakers in refining their speeches by integrating emotions and
                        expression into their content.</p>

                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='about-me-image.jpg') }}" alt="Vannsh Jagtiani" width="300">

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='public_speaking.webp') }}" style="width: -webkit-fill-available;">
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <h2>What Problem Do We Solve?</h2>
                    <p>Public speaking is more than just delivering words—it is about conveying emotion, passion, and authenticity.
                        Many speakers, whether beginners or experienced, find it difficult to imbue their speeches with the right
                        tone, emotional depth, and expressions that connect with their audience. Often, they struggle to assess how
                        their content is perceived emotionally, which can make even a well-written speech feel flat or disconnected.
                        This website solves that problem. By uploading your speech and selecting an emotional toggle, the app uses
                        advanced LLM technology to analyze your content and provide feedback on how to enhance it with the appropriate
                        emotions. Whether you're trying to inspire, persuade, or connect emotionally with your audience, the app gives
                        you suggestions on the tone and writing style adjustments to help you deliver a powerful and memorable speech.</p>

                    <h2>My Motivation</h2>
                    <p>Seeing individuals, especially neurodivergent students, face challenges in communication deeply moved me. I
                        realized that the ability to communicate effectively is a privilege, and I wanted to extend that to more
                        people.
                        I began with Awaaz Mitr, a project close to my heart, and it motivated me to further explore how technology
                        could assist in enhancing communication in different ways.
                        As a public speaker myself, I know firsthand how critical it is to connect emotionally with your audience. I
                        created this LLM-powered website to provide an accessible tool for public speakers of all kinds to master
                        not just the content of their speeches but also the emotional impact they have on their listeners. This project
                        is my way of ensuring that everyone can speak not just with words, but with emotions that truly resonate.</p>
