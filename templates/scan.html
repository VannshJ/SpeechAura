            <p>
              {% if emotion=="Happy" %}
            To convey happiness in your speech, focus on using an upbeat tone and positive language. Speak with energy and enthusiasm, 
            emphasizing key words that evoke joy or excitement. Incorporate uplifting imagery and anecdotes that resonate with your 
            audience. Smiling while you speak naturally brightens your voice and makes your words sound more engaging. Use a quicker 
            pace, but avoid rushing, as this can dilute the emotional impact. Additionally, vary your pitch to add a musical quality 
            to your delivery, emphasizing higher tones to reflect cheerfulness. Include affirming phrases such as “This is incredible” 
            or “We’re so fortunate,” and maintain eye contact to create a warm connection. Happy speeches also benefit from inclusive 
            language that draws the audience into your positivity, like “We’ve all experienced moments of pure delight.” Ending with an 
            inspiring call to action or gratitude reinforces the cheerful tone and leaves a lasting impression.
            {% endif %}

            {% if emotion=="Sad" %}
            To make your speech sound sad, focus on a softer, slower delivery with a lower pitch to reflect somberness. Use poignant 
            language that evokes empathy and vulnerability, such as “heartbreaking,” “loss,” or “painful.” Pauses are powerful tools to 
            let emotions settle and emphasize the weight of your words. Speak in a reflective tone, and let your voice tremble slightly 
            to convey genuine emotion. Share personal or relatable stories that allow your audience to connect emotionally. Avoid 
            dramatic overtones, as authenticity is key to moving your listeners. Use metaphors and imagery that evoke melancholy, 
            such as “a clouded sky” or “the echo of silence.” Dropping the volume at the end of sentences creates a sense of finality
            and loss. Additionally, avoid forced smiles or upbeat gestures, as these can dilute the emotional resonance. Conclude with
            a message of reflection or hope to provide solace amidst sadness.
            {% endif %}

            {% if emotion=="Angry" %}
            To sound angry in your speech, adopt a firm, forceful tone with sharper enunciation. Use a steady, deliberate pace, 
            occasionally quickening to reflect rising passion. Emphasize powerful, emotive words such as “outrageous,” “unacceptable,” 
            or “injustice” to convey indignation. Adjust your pitch to rise during moments of intense emotion, and lower it for stern 
            emphasis. Utilize rhetorical questions like “How could this happen?” to challenge your audience and provoke thought. Avoid 
            monotony by varying your volume and stressing key phrases. Facial expressions and gestures should align with your words, 
            displaying tension or frustration to reinforce your tone. Engage in purposeful repetition to underline critical points, 
            e.g., “This is not right—this cannot stand.” While anger can be impactful, avoid hostility or yelling, as it may alienate 
            listeners. Conclude with a decisive call to action, channeling anger into a constructive resolution.
            {% endif %}

            {% if emotion=="Neutral" %}
            To achieve a neutral tone, balance your speech with a steady, measured delivery. 
            Speak at a moderate pace with even volume and pitch, avoiding extremes in either direction. Use language that is factual and 
            objective, steering clear of overly emotional or charged words. Incorporate transitional phrases like “On the one hand” and 
            “On the other hand” to maintain an impartial perspective. Your tone should be calm and composed, fostering trust and 
            professionalism. Body language is equally important—keep gestures minimal and expressions controlled to avoid signaling bias. 
            Structure your speech to present balanced viewpoints, using evidence and logic to support your statements. Neutrality doesn’t 
            mean monotony; vary your cadence slightly to retain listener engagement without tipping into emotional territory. End with an 
            open-ended or thought-provoking statement, encouraging the audience to reflect and form their own opinions while respecting 
            the balanced tone of your delivery.
